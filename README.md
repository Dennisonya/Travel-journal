# Travel Journal

This is my solo project on the scrimba react course, this project is centered on the use of props in react.
I was able to achieve my goal of mapping through an array of object to populate my "Travel" component.
(FYI: I havent actually gone to any of these places in the journal yet:/, i just used them for referencesðŸ˜…)
